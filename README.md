> Privately-developed full-stack platform leveraging AI mentorship for design and validation—no generated code.

### 🔍 What This Is

This project is a technical experiment. Every decision—architecture, design, testing, feature planning—is made through discussion and iteration with an AI assistant.  
**No code is directly generated by AI**, but AI is used heavily as a mentor and problem-solving partner.

The purpose is to evaluate:

- How effectively an individual developer can build a complex product from scratch
- The value of pair-style interaction with AI in learning and productivity
- The viability of AI-assisted TDD, architectural planning, and debugging

---

### ⚠️ What This Is Not

- 🚫 A commercial app  
- 🚫 A polished codebase for reuse  
- 🚫 A team-maintained open source project  
- 🚫 A packaged release or ready-to-run environment

### 🧠 Core Technologies (In Progress)

- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async), Pydantic v2  
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Auth:** JWT + Argon2id, with email verification flow  
- **Testing:**
  - Pytest (test runner and assertion framework)
  - `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
  - `httpx.AsyncClient` for full integration testing of API routes
  - Manual and mocked email verification testing
  - Dependency overrides and isolated test database setup  
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized local environment, Cloudflare Tunnels, Traefik
